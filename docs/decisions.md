# LYNC — Architectural Decisions

## ADR-001: Next.js 15 over WordPress
- **Date:** March 29, 2026
- **Decision:** Replace WordPress + Elementor with Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Rationale:** Custom design, better performance, full control over data flow, Vercel deployment
- **Consequences:** Need to recreate all pages, but gain flexibility for quiz funnel + future integrations

## ADR-002: No Supabase in Phase 1
- **Date:** March 30, 2026
- **Decision:** Build frontend-only first, add Supabase later
- **Rationale:** Focus on visual rebuild + quiz UX before connecting backend
- **Consequences:** Quiz data stored client-side only for now, lead capture not functional until Phase 2

## ADR-003: Keep Acuity + Shopify (for now)
- **Date:** March 29, 2026
- **Decision:** Don't replace Acuity or Shopify yet — webhook into Supabase later
- **Rationale:** Working integrations, replacing them adds scope. Connect via webhooks first.
- **Consequences:** Events page will link to Acuity externally until Phase 3

## ADR-004: Placeholder fonts (Playfair Display + Inter)
- **Date:** March 30, 2026
- **Decision:** Use Playfair Display (display) and Inter (body) as placeholders for Mogena and Avenir
- **Rationale:** Mogena is a premium/custom font. Playfair Display captures similar editorial/serif energy. Boss can swap in Mogena when font files are available.
- **Update (March 31, 2026):** Playfair is no longer the global display font. See ADR-005.

## ADR-005: Mona Sans for titles; Playfair only on hero headline
- **Date:** March 31, 2026
- **Decision:** Use Mona Sans (`font-nav`, Google Fonts) for navigation, all marketing section titles, and default semantic headings (`h1–h6` base styles in `globals.css`). Reserve Playfair Display (`font-display`) for the **homepage hero `<h1>` only**. Non-hero titles use **uppercase**, **`font-semibold`**, and **`tracking-normal`** (wider tracking was tried with `tracking-wide` and reverted).
- **Rationale:** Keeps nav and titles in one sans voice; a single serif hero line preserves editorial emphasis without mixing display fonts across the page. Tighter letter-spacing reads better for long uppercase lines.
- **Consequences:** Inner pages and section headers render in Mona Sans. Hero remains visually distinct. Quiz question copy stays sentence case (semibold only, no forced uppercase).
