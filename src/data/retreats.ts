  founderStory:
    'I remember the exact moment. Sitting on a rock beside a waterfall deep in the jungle — barefoot, sun on my face, a dog I\'d never met curled beside me like we\'d known each other for years.\n\nI had been running for a long time. Between cities, between versions of myself, between who I thought I was supposed to be and who I could feel pulling at me from somewhere deeper. Costa Rica didn\'t care about any of that. The jungle has a way of stripping things back.\n\nHere, I found something I hadn\'t realised I was missing: stillness inside movement. I would wake before sunrise, walk barefoot to the beach while it was still dark, and simply breathe — watching the sky turn from black to pink to gold. And in that silence, I began to hear myself again.\n\nThe women I met changed me too. We cooked together, laughed until our sides ached, cried without explanation, held space for each other\'s truths without judgment. I understood then that transformation is not a solo journey — it happens in community, in the sacred circle of women willing to go there with you.\n\nCosta Rica gave me my heart back. And now I want to bring you here — to the place, the energy, and the medicine that changed everything for me. Because you deserve to feel what I felt on that rock beside that waterfall.',
